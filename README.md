# Superstore-Data-Analysis
Analyzed retail sales data using Python (pandas, matplotlib)
The dataset was found [https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000CWeX8SAL/sample-superstore-sales-excelxls] This is a dataset of retail sales of a national superstore from 2014 to 2017.

I investigated the profits, sales, and shipping times of products across region, state, and time by grouping, counting, and summing data using pandas. I also created various visualizations to find interesting insights about the store's operation.
